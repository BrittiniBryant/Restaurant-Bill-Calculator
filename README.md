# Restaraunt-Bill-Calculator
Console App Calculator (Python)


A super simple restaurant bill calculator made with Python. It assumes that the sales tax will be 8% and that the tip will be 20%. Those values cannot be changed (unless you modify the code to do so).

Small app was done as a homework assignment for a Python Programming class.
